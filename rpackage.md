# R package

For your convenience, we have an official R package! Not only does it make accessing p3k14c as easy as importing a package, it also contains all of the functions we used for our quality analysis and figure generation. Cool, right? It's available on our github at [github.com/people3k/p3k14c](https://github.com/people3k/p3k14c).
