               pronounced and abrupt Holocene cold and arid events. The 9.2 ka\
               event was similar, albeit of a smaller magnitude. Both events\
               affected the Northern Hemisphere climate and caused cooling and\
               aridification in Southwest Asia. Yet, the impacts of the 8.2 and\
               9.2 ka events on early farming communities in this region are\
               not well understood. Current hypotheses for an effect of the 8.2\

               In South America, although the background data on this issue has\

               taphonomy or researcher priorities among other aspects, all of\
               which require large datasets to resolve adequately. For this\
               report, we have created such a dataset for the South-Central\
               Andes (16\'b0-25\'b0S), here termed the South Central Andes\
               Radiocarbon (SCAR) database. SCAR spans the last 15,000 years\
               and incorporates ~1700 14C-dates from 519 archeological sites\
               reported across an extreme bioclimatic gradient that includes\
               the hyperarid coastal Atacama Desert and adjacent cold,\
               high-elevation Altiplano. Among the possible methodological\
               biases, we first evaluated those related to calibration\
               procedures. Otherwise, changes in summed probability curves show\
               no other relevant biases except for possible research\
               interest/priorities that could be responsible for the gaps in\
               the record from the Bolivian altiplano. Our temporally\
               continuous time-series indicates that prehispanic populations\
               exhibited significant demographic changes during the last\
               13,100calBP. Except for coastal populations; most regions show\
               strongly coordinated demographic fluctuations that follow the\
               same major patterns. Thus, we identified two broad scale\
               population events across the South-Central Andes (Atacama\
               inland, Bolivian Altiplano) from 13,100-4000calBP and then from\
               4000calBP to the present. In contrast, the Atacama coastal\
               records suggest a different and more variable occupation pattern\
               over the last 13,460calBP, which could be driven by the\
               interaction with oceanographic processes (i.e. upwelling). A\
               widespread major decline at 700calBP clearly predates the\
               Spanish colonization and occurs in all of our regions. This\
               widespread decline does not appear to be due to methodological\
               biases, and suggests that a population crash occurred before\
               European occupation. Overall, the SCAR database constitutes a\
               valuable proxy for establishing the long-term dynamics of\
               prehistoric societies that inhabited the western Andean slope.\
               Time-series analyses that use SCAR will shed new light on the\
               demographic and cultural dynamics at different spatial-scales,\
               and help clarify the processes involved in the migrational\
               trajectories and cultural evolution of the peoples that\
               inhabited the South-Central Andes over the last 15,000 years.",\

               particularly true for the spread of farming practices in\

               the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods across the Near East and\

               one observed in or around the centre of farming innovation and\
               involving a boost in carrying capacity; a second appearing in\

               scholars for a long time. However, exploring the long-term\
               relation between prehistoric demography and climate change\
               remains challenging because of the absence of an effective proxy\
               for population reconstruction. Recently, the summed probability\
               distribution of archaeological radiocarbon dates has been widely\
               used as a proxy for human population levels, although\
               researchers recognize that such usage must be cautious. This\
               approach is rarely applied in China due to the lack of a\
               comprehensive archaeological radiocarbon database, and thus the\
               relation between human population and climate change in China\
               remains ambiguous. Herein we systematically compile an\
               archaeological14C database (n=4656) for China for the first\
               time. Using the summed probability distributions of the\
               radiocarbon dates alongside high-resolution palaeoclimatic\
               records, we show that: 1) the commencement of major population\
               expansion in China was at 9kacalBP, occurring after the\
               appearance of agriculture and associated with the early Holocene\
               climate amelioration; 2) the major periods of small population\
               size and population decline, i.e., 46-43kacalBP, 41-38kacalBP,\
               31-28.6kacalBP, 25-23.5kacalBP, 18-15.2kacalBP, and\
               13-11.4kacalBP, correspond well with the dating of abrupt cold\
               events in the Last Glacial (LG) such as the Heinrich and Younger\
               Dryas (YD) events, while the major periods of high-level\
               population in the Holocene, i.e., 8.5-7kacalBP, 6.5-5kacalBP and\
               4.3-2.8kacalBP, occur at the same times as warm-moist conditions\
               and Neolithic cultural prosperity, suggesting that abrupt\
               cooling in the climate profoundly limited population size and\
               that mild climate episodes spurred a growth in prehistoric\
               populations and advances in human cultures; and 3) populations\
               in different regions experience different growth trajectories\
               and that their responses to climate change are varied, due to\
               both regional environmental diversity and the attainment of\
               different levels of adaptive strategies. \\copyright\{\} 2014\
