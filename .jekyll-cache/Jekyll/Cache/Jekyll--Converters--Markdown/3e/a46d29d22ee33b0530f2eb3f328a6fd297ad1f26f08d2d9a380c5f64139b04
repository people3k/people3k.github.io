<p>p3k14c has been made possible through the generous sharing of data from archaaeologists
across the world. If you have some radiocarbon dates that aren’t in p3k14c, we 
want to add them! Submitting your data increases the dissemination of your work, 
fills in geographical gaps, and contributes to the future of how we understand 
ourselves and our ancestors.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, feel free to email the p3k14c data stewardship team
at <a href="mailto:steward@p3k14c.org">steward@p3k14c.org</a>. We’ll get back to you as 
soon as we can!</p>
