<h1 id="bugfixes">Bugfixes</h1>

<ul>
  <li>All LabIDs are now standardized to ABC-1234 format prior to the cleaning procedure. This fixed an issue causing duplicate dates when a given date appeared multiple times with slight capitalization and separator variations in its LabID (e.g. MC-555, Mc555, Mc-555)</li>
  <li>36 dates with malformed LabIDs placing the numerals before the letters, primarily from the ManningTimpson2014 dataset, have been temporarily removed while we investigate finding their true lab identifiers.</li>
</ul>
