<p>p3k14c has been made possible through the generous sharing of data from archaaeologists
across the world. If you have some radiocarbon dates that aren‚Äôt in p3k14c, we 
want to add them! Submitting your data increases the dissemination of your work, 
fills in geographical gaps, and contributes to the future of how we understand 
ourselves and our ancestors.</p>

<h2 id="submission-instructions">Submission instructions</h2>

<p>Before handing off your data to us, we ask that you format it in a few ways so 
as to make the process of integrating it into p3k14c as smooth as possible:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Remove all non-archaeological radiocarbon dates</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Format the data using the p3k14c column schema.</strong> We provide a [starting 
header] to assist with this. At a minimum, data is required in the
<em>LabID, Age, Error, LocAccuracy, Country,</em> and <em>Continent</em> columns. 
Refer to the <a href="/codebook">codebook</a> for descriptions of each column.</li>
  <li><strong>Include a ‚ÄúLocAccuracy‚Äù for each date</strong>. LocAccuracy is a general rating
of the accuracy of a given date‚Äôs location. It ranges from 0 (lowest accuracy) 
to 3 (highest accuracy) according to the following scale: <br />
 0: No specific locational information / only date‚Äôs Country provided<br />
 1: Province/State (non-US) or county (US) locational information<br />
 2: Very close locational information (within 500m)<br />
 3: Exact location of site provided / data‚Äôs source collected personally<br /></li>
</ol>
