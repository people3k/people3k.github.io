<p>Comprised of over 170,000 dates from all across the world, the PEOPLE 3000
Radiocarbon Database (P3k14C) is the largest and most geographically complete
dataset of global archaeological radiocarbon (¬π‚Å¥C) dates ever constructed.
With each date having been collected and cleaned according to a rigorous,
unified protocol, P3k14C presents a new standard for leveraging the potential 
of dates-as-data to study the evolution of past human societies. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01118-7">See the
