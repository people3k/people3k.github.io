<p><strong>Note!</strong> To protect against looting, dates for the United States, Canada, and
the Guedes and Bocinsky (2018) database have had their precise coordinates 
“fuzzed” to instead be the centroid of the encompassing county or
other administrative subdivision. Archaeological professionals may <a href="https://core.tdar.org/dataset/459172/p3k14c-scrubbed">request
access to the true-coordinates dataset</a> through the Digital Archaeological Record
(tDAR).</p>
